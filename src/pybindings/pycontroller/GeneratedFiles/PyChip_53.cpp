The TLVReader\n object operates as a cursor that can be used to iterate over a sequence of TLV elements\n and interpret their contents.  When positioned on an element, applications can make calls\n to the reader's Get() methods to query the current element’s type and tag, and to extract\n any associated value.  The reader’s Next() method is used to advance from element to element.\n\n A TLVReader object is always positioned either before, on or after a TLV element.  When first\n initialized, a TLVReader is positioned immediately before the first element of the encoding.\n To begin reading, an application must make an initial call to the Next() method to position\n the reader on the first element.  When a container element is encountered--either a structure,\n an array or a path--the OpenContainer() or EnterContainer() methods can be used to iterate\n through the contents of the container.\n\n When the reader reaches the end of a TLV encoding, or the last element within a container,\n it signals the application by returning a CHIP_END_OF_TLV error from the Next() method.\n The reader will continue to return CHIP_END_OF_TLV until it is reinitialized, or the current\n container is exited (via CloseContainer() / ExitContainer()).\n\n A TLVReader object can parse data directly from a fixed input buffer, or from memory provided\n by a TLVBackingStore.");
